# SELinux: Mesa finds GPUs with libdrm (drmGetDevices2), which reads the GPU's PCI ID files in
# sysfs, in every app. Google labels those files sysfs_gpu (readable by apps, SurfaceFlinger...)
# only at the Intel iGPU's fixed slot 00:02.0. Same label here for function 0 of any device behind
# a PCIe bridge, where discrete GPUs sit (genfscon wildcards: the policy has
# genfs_seclabel_wildcard). SSDs/NICs at such slots get it too: their ID files merely become
# readable by the graphics domains. Domain 0 only (consumer PCs). Init compiles the policy.
